| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `0. Print a list of integers` | Write a function that prints all integers of a list. |
| `1. Secure access to an element in a list`| Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C. |
| `2. Replace element` | Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order. |
| `3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!`| Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order. |
| `4. Replace in a copy` | Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C). |
| `5. Can you C me now?`| Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string. |
| `6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need` | Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. |
| `7. islower`| Write a function that checks for lowercase character. |
| `8. To uppercase` | Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line. |
| `9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important`| Write a function that prints the last digit of a number. |
| `10. a + b` | Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result. |
| `11. a ^ b`| Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value. |
| `12. Fizz Buzz` | Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space. |
| `13. Insert in sorted linked list`| Technical interview preparation... |
| `14. Smile in the mirror` | Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line. |
| `15. Remove at position`| Write a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”). |
| `16. ByteCode -> Python #2` | Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode |
