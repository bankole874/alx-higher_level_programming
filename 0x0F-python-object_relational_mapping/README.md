# 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

In the first part, we will use the module MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and execute your SQL queries.

In the second part, we will use the module SQLAlchemy, an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).

The biggest difference is: no more SQL queries! Indeed, the purpose of an ORM is to abstract the storage to the usage. With an ORM, our biggest concern will be ‚ÄúWhat can I do with my objects‚Äù and not ‚ÄúHow this object is stored? where? when?‚Äù. We won‚Äôt write any SQL queries only Python code. Last thing, your code won‚Äôt be ‚Äústorage type‚Äù dependent. We will be able to change our storage easily without re-writing our entire project.
